# ZSL

## Introduction:
#### In this 2D web application game, players will build the greenhouse gas footprint chain for four products; mobile phones, beef, leaving electronic devices on standby and plastic bottles by identifying the next steps in the chain using a tell-tale game method. Players will have three choices on which step they believe comes next in the chain, and will obtain points for every correct answer. A habitat animal narrator will guide players through the journey, providing the correct sequence of events and educational facts for enhanced learning. At the end of the game, players will have the opportunity to provide a pledge on how they promise to try and help.

### Objective of the Game:
#### The objective of the game is for each team to complete the greenhouse gas footprint chain for the four products in a fun and interactive way. 

### Genre:
#### The genre of the game is an educational interactive tell-tale game.

### Features:
### •	2D game
### •	Team play
### •	Visual feedback
### •	Educational
### •	Interactive
### •	Tell-tale

### Platform:
#### This game will be a web-based application, designed for use with on an Apple iPad using iOS 10.3.3.

### Intended Audience:
#### The intended audience of this game is for casual or non-gamers of both genders from the age of 11 to 16, however the primary age range is 11 to 12 years old. 

### Language:
#### The game will only be in English

### Sound Consideration:
#### The game play experience is not dependant on sound and as such the game does not require speakers of any kind.

### Scope
#### This documentation is meant to be read by programmers, artists and producers involved in the design implementation and testing of “Eco Warriors”. The App is for a target age of 11-16 year olds, along with this the app has to be very informative and interactive, ZSL required these for the app to be successful.

## Project Management Documentation
#### Since this project has a large scope, a plan had to be thought of by breaking up the tasks in order to focus on individual sections of the project. In order to do this, we have spilt up the project requirements into epics and user stories, this meant that the project was able to be looked at from the small tasks rather than the entire project as a whole. Doing this idea allowed us to look at the requirements for the user and also the software requirements within the project. Having the tasks separated allowed us to focus on each task individually and would make the project much easier.



### Project Overview
#### Matthew Kaptur, Codrin Axnite, Daniel Edson, Oliver Slape
#### We have been contacted by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and they have asked us to design and produce an educational game that is based around the greenhouse chain that have 4 products (Plastic bottles, Mobile Phones, Beef and Electronics left on stand-by) which affect these 4 habitats (Ocean, Rainforest, Countryside, Arctic Tundra). This game can be used and accessible by anyone but will be mainly used in classes that the ZSL run at London Zoo for 11-16 year olds, the first of which will be run on the 14th November 2017. Regular meetings will be held with the client so that information and feedback can be given on some of ideas and on anything they would want to change so that the client can be satisfied. 

### Aims: 
#### 1. Create an enjoyable game that is suitable for the ages of 11-16years 
#### 2. Have interactive menu that can easily navigate within the game
#### 3. Make it educational, which also include the facts that are correct and would suit the purpose of the application
#### 4. Raise awareness in the game so that when they complete it they will be aware of these hazards
#### 5. Implement a clear pledge system within the application

### Objectives:
#### 1. Research the main facts for each of the habitats that suit the purpose of the game
#### 2. Research and find a suitable style of graphics/assets that will be part of the application
#### 3. Find a suitable software or IDE that will help in building the application
#### 4. Research correct techniques that is related to the software or IDE used to build the interactive menu
#### 5. Create a list of pledges that will be used, that are related to each of the habitats within the game

#### These were some of the objectives for the project, these were like the user stories however a lot more specific to a task. These with the user stories helped us focus on the project better and allowed us to work more efficiently when delivering out training event within ZSL.

## Project Management Plan
#### This part of the document specifies a plan for the development of the game and outlines the resources and schedule that will be included within the development. It will be subject to change during the game's development. The plan is based of the objectives and aims in the previous section. When designing the game, there are many aspects when looking at the different stages of completion that need to be looked at before starting the development plan, here are the aspects of the game I have to look at.

### Cost:
#### The first thing that was looked upon is the time, since this project was for a competition which means the work we were doing was for free, so the cost of our time equalled to £0. Secondly, the items that 'cost' money was the systems that were used to create the app. So in order for use to develop the application, we needed to have a system which exceeded our needs and requirements. The systems that were used at college are roughly around £1500 each. This brings the cost up to £6000 as they're 4 of us within the group.
#### The next cost is the software that was used. The main software that we used to develop the app was Unity, this software cost around £130 per person for a pro license, this means that between all 4 of us it will be £520. Other software used such and Photoshop and other adobe software would roughly cost £40 a month for each software, rounding this up would be £480 for 2 months.
#### The cost of the internet is unknown as we were developing the game within the college premises, so we were unable to know the cost.
#### The final cost is the commute from the college to the ZSL Whipsnade centre, as we had to hire a minibus which the college did and so we do not know the precise amount that was payed for minibus.

### Scope:
#### In this project we decided to create a fun interactive game for the dedicated age range. Since the time limit was not major and limited we had to simplify the ideas that chosen in order to meet the deadline, but also to make sure we stay in the scope of the project. 

### Time:
#### The total amount of time that was given to us was 5 weeks to complete the application. 2 weeks was given to complete all of the required design documentation. Also within the first 2 weeks a proposal document had to be completed to present and show the client the idea that will be used. The 3rd and 4th week was where the development and construction of the application, the final week was then used to finalise the application by testing everything and making sure that all the assets and mechanics worked. 

### Quality:
#### Since this project was for an actual professional client with a need to use for an actual audience. The quality of the application has to be high so that the client can be impressed on how well it looks compared to their imagination. This was of course checked throughout the process of development so that the application is presented professionally and visually looks that it was developed in high standards as they suggested.

### Communication:
#### During the project we communicated a huge amount within the group and to the client so that we may find out any changes the client might want. We kept up to date with everything and team meetings were held once a week so that we can discuss on some of the ideas at hand. Communication with the client was by email so we had to wait for a reply every now and then to check if the ideas that we had for the application were good for them to approve on. This helped a lot during the project as we knew then afterwards that we were on the right path and knew what the outcome of the project will be.

### Risk:
#### The main risk we had was the reputation. Since this was one of our first clients, we knew that we had to make a good long lasting impression for them so that they would maybe would like to work with us again in the future. This can also help with other contacts they have and would approve us to the tasks they might have related to our course. Having this reputation for our first client can also make us more noticeable by other clients and realise that we were a part of this project and that we did an excellent job during this project.

### Resources:
#### A number of resources were used to complete the project:
#### 1. System/PC: At least a decent computer must be used in order help with the development of the game. The computer must be matching the minimum requirements of the software that will be used during development and to make sure that it can run well without issues.
#### 2. Internet Access: Internet access will absolutely necessary because research will be carried out in this project; secondary research by reading articles and webpages and primary research with web surveys and such. This will also be used to keep track of analytics of players in multiplayer games and to test the multiplayer portion of the game, as well as eventual publishing of the game.
#### 3. Unity Pro: The game will be developed in unity, reasons being that I have past experience of using the engine and that it has features that can help me with developing the game. Also the software is must easier to use and allows to do certain tasks which are easier on here than on other software or IDEs.
#### 4. Adobe(Software): Most of the adobe software was used for some part of the application Photoshop and Animate CC which was used to create the animations and graphics that were used within the project.
#### 5. Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint): These two pieces of software were used for the documentation of the project and the presentations that were used when we had meetings with the client. 

## Schedule:
![Gant Chart](https://github.com/kap14275819/ZSL/blob/master/gant%20chart.png)
#### This Gantt chart shows how the time was planned and managed throughout the project, this graph shows how we planned to spend the time given to us on this project and also how we planned for the risks of the project by allocating the contingency times for the project allowing extra time in case there were halts in time.

### Burndown Chart
![Burndown chart](https://github.com/kap14275819/ZSL/blob/master/burndown%20chart.PNG)
#### This shows how the project went in terms of tasks to time when completing the project, the straight line was the predicted or required work to be done within the project and the other line is the pace we went at during the project in comparison to the predicted pace of the project.

## Critical Reasoning on the ZSL project
#### The reasons on why we first chose to do this project was because that we wanted to expand our mind-set on other types of software and to expand our knowledge on how clients would specifically like their type of game to look like. This gave us good experience which can be used in future projects with other clients as we will understand much better than before. This project with ZSL was also done on IOS which was a slight push back as it had a few restraints on our work as some parts of the game would have been inaccessible. The reason it was done on IOS also is that the ZSL clients only had IOS devices to support the game on which was a challenge but we knew how to overcome that later on. This had to be on a mobile app because ZSL wanted the game to be used easily and so that the audience would understand it much faster than using computers or other devices. Also this had to be on a mobile device because the only devices they had to have the game running was those. This device was also good for the audience which was for 11-16 year olds which would understand how to use them much easier than other certain devices. Doing this project on this device means that other people who are not visiting any of the ZSL zoo's and are just visiting the website would be able to access this game on their tablets or mobile phones or even on their PC which will allow them to try it out also. This can be used for teachers in schools which they can use for their students to go through the game to help them learn about the greenhouse gas chain. The audience for this project was for 11-16 year olds this was because if school attended one of these zoo's they would also have an experience in doing this game within the zoo. One of the staff members would have one of the classes to try out the game and to test their knowledge on this subject. This project was all about the environment and greenhouse gases, the reason why was because the idea of the game was to look at how the world is becoming polluted by the certain types of industries. So the project had to be about the four habitats which was the countryside, the tundra, the ocean and the rainforest. These four habitats have certain industries destroying the landscape and creating pollution. So this had to be shown to the children to show them what can be done to stop this type of destruction.


## Group Roles and Shared Targets: 
#### 1. Matthew Kaptur: Project Management, Project Design, Project Documentation.
#### 2. Codrin Axinte: Programmer, Project Research.
#### 3. Oliver Slape: Programmer, Project Research.
#### 4. Daniel Edson: Project Design, Project Research.
#### 5. Bec Nash: Project Research, Project Documentation.

#### One of the main targets we all had was the completion of the game itself but also some of the smaller targets we had was on deciding on some of the game designs and gameplay of the game itself.

## Tools and Techniques
## Tools
### Photoshop
#### Photoshop was used in our project to create the characters that the player would choose at the beginning of the game which will represent them for the rest of the game. We also used Photoshop to edit some of the background on the four habitats and some of assets that were used in the game. This saved us some money instead of buying everything from the web which some were quite expensive. We also used Photoshop to create the maze in are first prototype of our game. 
![photoshop](https://github.com/kap14275819/ZSL/blob/master/photoshop.PNG)
### GitHub
#### We used GitHub quite a lot to have most of our documentation shared between all of us so when we are not in class this can be uploaded and used by our whole group at home to then also modify it. This helped to keep backup of our work so that in case it was lost on someone’s drive then we knew there is a backup on GitHub. 

### Unity
#### Unity was a huge help to us as it was used to create the application. Unity was one of the best choices to use as it had functions which allowed multiple members of the group modify parts of the game and then shared between everyone in the group. This helped complete the application in a much faster pace as multiple members were involved in the process. It was a very easy to use tool and has a huge range of assets that could have been used.

### PowerPoint
#### PowerPoint was only used for our presentations, this was to present our concept designs and ideas that we thought of on one of the first pitch meetings we had with the ZSL representatives. This was also used to show the final look and design on PowerPoint. We showed are finished design and how we adapted to feedback. The reason we used PowerPoint was that it is the simplest and best presentation software out there. We also used PowerPoint online so all four of us could work on different slides for the certain parts of work that each person did.
#### This is a link to a google slides which shows the presentation that was used for one of the meetings in the project:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IOegb4ybkjDdYNkHyYtOlcA6BDotrsn-2zseRPsYzSA/edit?usp=sharing 
## Techniques
### Interviews
#### Multiple interviews with ZSL. The first one was with a ZSL representative Michelle who came in to explain the project that she wanted for us to work on. We all took notes so that we could get more information from what she was saying as well as off the PowerPoint she used to present out some of the information. The other interviews we had was when we presented our concept designs and ideas and then the final interview which was showing the completion of the whole game. 

### Prototyping
#### Prototyping was used when creating different variations of the game that we wanted in Unity which we also tested after doing each section of the prototypes. We all took notes so that we could get more information from what she was saying as well as off the Power Point she had. This also helped us in checking whether this idea will work and how long does it take to make it successful. 

### Presentations
#### We presented are game in a presentation as it is easy to get your points across and it captures people’s attention when you are standing at the front of the room and have your presentation behind you. You can also use your body language and speaking skills to help present your work and get it across

### Management 
#### We used SCRUM to manage our workload and to break down the tasks that have been given to us so that we are able spread work to each of the group members to ease the load. This helped as it allowed us to finish multiple tasks at one time and it was faster as we did not have to work on each task one at a time which then might waste more time overall.
## Software Investigation
## First Client Meeting (2nd October 2017)
#### The first time we met the client was on the 2nd of October, a representative from ZSL came into the college to give a presentation on what they roughly want within the game. This included some of the requirements that had to be within the game, such as what the game should look like, the genre of the game, target audience and how much time there given to complete the whole game.

### Problems to Solve
#### The first thing that we encountered on the specifications was that the game had to be used on IOS tablets which means that it will be not that flexible in making it into an app so it had to be done on a web browser through the IOS tablets. Secondly the time spectrum was not very long so we know we had to work as hard as we can to complete it. The genre was of course about the environment and it had to be based on four habitats so this slightly simplified the work load. So this gave us a foundation to start the game on but another problem was that the audience is 11-16 year olds but slightly focused on 11-12 more. This was slightly difficult to compose our ideas relatable to that age range.

### Time Allocated 
#### We have 15 days from the first meeting to come up with a concept idea to present to the ZSL representatives. For this we have allocated a time frame of 12 days to come up with a concept pitch, this then allows us 3 days extra just in case a problem occurs such as a team member not being present or if a design change is agreed upon.

#### The first 7 days were dedicated on coming up with our game concept. This will include in creating concept art that we can show the client so that they can have a clear picture of what we intend to make. The end game result will be decided as well, how the player will interact with the game and how the information will be conveyed to the player. This should take some time as planning and getting ideas together is important for the whole structure of the game.

#### The next 8 days will be used to finalise any of the work that has been decided on and starting to create the concept pitch presentation that we will be giving to the client on the 17th. More time has been given to this task as we want to make the presentation as professional as possible and so that all other tasks are up to date.

## Preparation
#### In order to prepare for the final pitch our team will need to divide the work up evenly between the 4 of us. This is how we decided to divide the work.

### Matthew and Daniel (PowerPoint)
#### Matthew and Codrin will be in charge of creating the PowerPoint presentation which will include all of the concept art that will be used within the game. Daniel will be focused more on the creating the concept art that will be presented whilst Matthew will be focusing on adding in all the necessary information that will explain all the features that will be in the application. 2 members of the group were put to this task as we knew that PowerPoint is the main asset that will be showing all the work we have put together to create the app, so we wanted to make sure it was completed on time and to a high standard.

### Bec(Handouts)
#### Bec will be responsible for creating the handouts that will be given to the ZSL representatives that will be present at the pitch. In these handouts they will include the same information that will be on the PowerPoint presentation but will also have some extra detailed information as the PowerPoint which only have points in that will be expanded on whilst the handout will have all of the info within in. Bec will be working closely to Matthew and Codrin so that the handouts and the PowerPoint have the same information.

### Oliver and Codrin(Script/Notes)
#### Olvier and Codrin will be creating the script and notes that will be used during the presentation. This will be important so that the notes can help if the person presenting will get stuck on a point that is vital for the audience to know about it. For this they will have to work with Matthew to make sure the points and notes are connected. 

## Concept Pitch (17th October 2017)
#### On the 17th of October, we went to Whipsnade zoo to deliver our concept pitch and some ideas that we thought of to include within the game we designed. For this we created a PowerPoint presentation that showed the features that the app will have and how it would look to the audience. Concept art will be included of the main menu and some of the in-game scenes.

### Problems to Solve
#### We already created a contingency plan if the presentation does not work correctly so we printed out handouts of what the presentation would look like in case if it does not load up correctly which will be given to the ZSL representatives. Back-ups were also done on multiple USB drives so that it one gets corrupted or the file does not load then we will have access to another copy. 

#### Some of the ideas we had presented were slightly off course of what the representatives visualised but in this it helped us understand more of what they imagined it would look like. The feedback was very useful as we were unsure on some minor parts of the game. But this set us back on track with exactly what had to be done for the client to approve it. 

## Quantitative Research (Survey)
#### So to make sure that the ideas were suitable for the audience/client, we needed to conduct some research to see if people agreed with the statements we had. To do this we produced a quantitative survey that we then handed out too many of our colleagues and other students to check what their opinion is on our design. The statements had answers that ranged from 1-10, with 1 being "Strongly Agree" and 10 being "Strongly Disagree". The maximum amount of colleagues we asked was 15 and roughly another 15 random students were asked also to fill out the survey on the game. Each person was shown the following 3 images of our game (With a description of what is happening) and were asked the following statements.

### Statement 1. The artistic design shown is suitable for children aged between 11 - 16.
### Average Response - 8.8
#### The average mean for this statement was an 8.8. This shows that a very strong indication that the art style that was used is close to what you would expect from a children’s game. But some aspects of the art can be tweaked on. We decided that we would need to ask questions to the client to get a more detailed response on the art style.

### Statement 2. The game CLEARLY presents the greenhouse gas chain information.
### Average Response - 9.2
#### The average mean for this statement was a 9.2 which was very good. This showed us that the information about the greenhouse gas chain was presented very well and that all the info was clearly visible for everyone to see. This means that the game is meeting the educational requirement that the client set for us.  

### Statement 3. The game looks simple and intuitive to play (Easy Controls and Easy to Play).
### Average Response - 6.8
#### The average mean for this statement was slightly low with a 6.8. This was asked so that we can makes sure that the game could be quickly picked up without any details to explain what they have to do. So this had to be improved on slightly before they start will show a short example of what to do before the game starts. 

### Statement 4. The game looks entertaining and engaging.
### Average Response - 5.4
#### This statement was hard for the reviewer to answer as they did not have a version of the game to play or try out at the time. This was still useful as it still gave us an idea of how it would feel like from other people’s opinion even though they couldn't try it out. We already knew that further testing would be needed for the demo to be finished. The response to this was mixed, averaging 5.4 with highs of 9 and lows of 3. This was expected for this question because as stated before, this question is more difficult to answer without access to a demo. However, it gave some indication that work was needed to make the game more engaging.

### Qualitative Research (Client Feedback)
#### After we had delivered out concept pitch. We openly asked the client for any feedback, good or bad, on our ideas in order to collect more detailed information on our ideas and how they meet or do not meet their needs.

#### The ZSL representatives were quite pleased with the graphics style that was used for the background and some of the animations. They knew that this made it look engaging to the younger audience. However, they expressed concern that perhaps we had used more cartoon style for our art work, so the older side of the target audience would not appreciate it as much. But overall thought it still would be fine.
#### One of the main points that the client was particularly focused about was that how would we present the greenhouse gas chain information to the audience. So they did not feel that we had made the greenhouse gas chain the main focus of the game and they believe that our current design does not relate to the greenhouse gas chain. A lot of feedback was given about parts that can be improved on. The main point was that we were not including all of the greenhouse gas information. The representatives recommended that we focus less on mini games and more on the greenhouse gas chain itself so that all the information is put across.

## Final Meeting (Deadline 7th November 2017)
#### As we had everything ready for the pitch to show the amount of effort we have put into the game and to make it suit the needs of the audience and of the client’s vision of how it would look like. So we also prepared backups on multiple USB drives if our presentation fails and so we know we have a spare. Also we have the game available to use on some tablets which we have brought ourselves so that it can be used by the judges to see how it feels for them and whether they like how the whole game works itself. 
#### Unfortunately our group did not get chosen out of the other groups that were there but we found out that we were the runners up and thought that our idea was very good and it very well made overall but had a hard decision between the two. 

## Conclusion 
#### Overall in my opinion the whole team work well together as we combined ideas and suggestions that might make the game better or more appealing to the audience. We had a few problems on some parts but worked it out in the end as team always helped one another out if they were stuck on something that they couldn't get their head around. It was a good experience and challenge especially in the short amount of time given and would love to try another sometime soon.

## Review:
#### The project was a good challenge for us as we had a lot of ups and downs which created some problems which were then fixed. So the pros about this project is that it gave a good amount of experience on different software such as unity. Using this software has expanded are knowledge on creating new games in the future and we will already understand how to use the software because of this project. Another reason is that it has given us an idea of how to understand a client’s requirements, because during the planning we looked at the requirements and planned on different ideas which then the client didn't like as to what they visioned it would be. So overall the project went well and we understood what had to be done in the end as showed prototypes of the project and the client then agreed on it. I personally think that it was a good effort in the end as we had many ideas which then led to a great idea and we worked well in a team and all stuck to our jobs to what had to be made and i think that it was fun and challenging experience.
